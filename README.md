# 🍔 Uber Eats Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes **3 months of Uber Eats order data** (3M+ orders and 206K users) to uncover key trends in **customer behavior, retention, and operational performance**.

The goal was to explore real-world business questions like:
- What drives repeat orders?
- Which departments show the strongest loyalty?
- When do users order the most, and how does that affect operations?

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and model raw order data for analysis  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs & trends  
- Derive actionable insights to optimize **retention**, **acquisition**, and **operations**

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visuals  
- **Excel / SQL** – data cleaning and exploration  
- **GitHub** – documentation and sharing  

## 🧩 Dataset Summary
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Time Period | 3 months |
| Orders | 3,000,000+ |
| Users | 206,000 |
| Key Columns | order_id, user_id, department, reorder_flag, order_day, order_hour, etc. |

## 📊 Key Findings
**High dependency on niche departments**  
- Alcohol (~70% reorder rate) and Coffee Filters (#2) dominate repeat purchases.  
- Essentials like groceries and pasta trail under 40% — risky for sustainability.

**Loyal but stagnant user base**  
- 90% of orders come from returning users; only ~10% are new.  
- Average orders per user ≈ 14.5 → strong loyalty, weak acquisition.

**Weekend order spikes**  
- 45% of volume occurs on Fri/Sat evenings → rush-hour strain & midweek underuse.

**Overall retention**  
- Reorder rate = 59.86%; solid but uneven across categories.

## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations
- Diversify beyond high-performing “fun” categories (Alcohol, Coffee Filters).  
- Launch promo campaigns to attract **new users**.  
- Optimize delivery schedules to balance **weekday vs. weekend** load.  
- Leverage loyalty for **upselling** and increasing basket size.
